# Python text converter app
The app was initally meant as a desktop app that would convert strings based on programmed rulesets (eg. randomcase). 
I think it's currently programmed with UwU-case. 

## google translate API integration
I then linked the app with google translate's API to get it to speak. 
I deeply regret this decision. 

# DEVELOPMENT STATUS 
The app was made using an outdated version of [desktop-app-template](https://github.com/yaq1n0/desktop-app-template). 
Which means this thing probably still runs on Python 2.7, and the libraries I used and the API has probably stopped working. 
I might revisit this at some point to bring it back to life.
